# MirrorApp

Self-reflection web app demonstrating a simple mood grid and journaling feature. This version runs as a plain Express server and vanilla React front-end so you can host it anywhere.

## Development

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

3. Start the server

```bash
node server.js
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.
